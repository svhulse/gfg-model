# gfg-model
Code for multi-locus gene-for-gene model

raster.py is used to generate a raster file of multiple simulations, allowing two parameters to be simultaneously varied

allelic_model.py contains the code for running each simulation, it depends on utilities.py

utilities.py contains helper functions for allelic_model.py and has functions for converting the raw data generated by raster.py into matrices for several variables of interest.
